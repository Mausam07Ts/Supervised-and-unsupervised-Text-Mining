Review
"It is so fun and I really recommend Spotify, however you do have to pay to get premium wich u can listen to music without ads and without Wi-Fi, but overall GREAT awesome"
"I have had Spotify for 3 years now and with premium it is really good because you can listen ad free without having to be on the app, my family uses the family plan and we all use and love it"
"I love to listen to music from the 60s both in English and Spanish, I can get an excellent selection of the music I love from Spotify."
We were able to keep all our playlists when we changed phones and resubscribed with Spotify. It was a real bonus. We love the amount of music geared toward those easy listening and hip hop that we enjoy. Thank you very much for the good work!!! We are satisfied and happy to continue with Spotify.
"Honestly can't stand free Spotify ( it probably doesn't bother everyone as much but oh my god for me I might've deleted the app if I couldn't get premiumüò≠ ) but Spotify with premium I really enjoy everything there and use it pretty much everyday. I also like the for you weekly playlists,I've found so many new songs I really like off there.(+premium or not Spotify is still the best music/podcast app I've been able to find ever imo)"
It's very sad that collecting CDs has gone away. But having premium Spotify allows me to have just about everything I could want without having to lug around my cd binder. Works great and have enjoyed it for many years now.
"I love the app if I could rate it out of then I'd say nine though, the reason is because the ads are soo annoying but overall I like the app it has various options of music and you can find most songs that you want"
"Extremely happy......and a suggestion, to smoother the transition between two songs in a queue...... basically to make the time interval between two songs in a queue next to zero.........Otherwise very happy with Spotify......good experience"
I love that this app shows you the lyrics and sometimes with videos too. I can also play my Spotify music on Alexa which makes it better. Spotify also plays music continually even without paying for subscription.
"I have used both Napster and Amazon music. I have to say that I find Spotify to be the better app. I love the fade feature, more importantly the car safety feature. Only grumble I have is I wish it had more equalizer functions, like concert etc. . Awesome app!! Very happy!@"
Perfect app. Great stability and streaming. I have been a Premium member for a year and Spotify does not disappoint ^-^
I love this app so simple to use and store all your favorite music üé∂ ! I just wish they had a yearly subscription instead of paying monthly.
"Stopped using YouTube and went to Spotify. Far less ads, the music is organized and easy to focus on single artists or genres."
"Five stars all day long, best layout for a music streaming app. You can filter the playlists anyway you want to alphabetically by title is my favourite. I'll update in a month or 2 when I have upgraded to the family plan!"
"I've been using Spotify for years now, and I love it. All the music I need is here and I have been enjoying prime student."
Personally I think this app is way better than pandora. Been using Spotify for over two years and the range of music just seems to get better and better. So thank you for creating it. üëå
"Pretty cool app. But it would be better if the adds were reduced. Also, it's better if you provide the original thing. You know, sometimes I feel the original voice of a song is different from what you provide in the app."
THIS music app is amazing i use this app from 7 month and not send me wrote notifications and any sing this app use very low ammount internet for play any music I love this thing I this way I play nonstops music contiusely and one amazing thing you no go anytime in search bar for music because if u like a song it show on your loby automatically and many things to see like. Stories. Cast related books for listening it work very faster for add new music in this app. I wish in nest update add stori
My personal rating and use experience. I enjoyed listening to music from Spotify. I give it 5 Stars because an app that does this good for you deserves nothing less. Keep up the good work to the workers behind the scenes. It's good work and it is noticeable to us!!! üé∂ üéµ ‚èπ
It's such a good app I just lüíúVE it i'm and army and k-pop fan I can listen song very clearly and good quality it doesn't require more data also it's a good app üòÅ‚úå‚ù§üíú and one drawback is that it plays ads for every two songs it's just *trusfating*üôÑ rather than that I just l‚ô°VE this appüòä
Now if only I could figure out the repeat option ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Sure some of my libraries aren't too long but I'd be nice if it kept playing instead of stopping after 1 play through.
I have used spotify for ever! I love it so much it is great for podcasts when I walk and ofc music is a wide variety...100% recommend
Most recent/ listened to stuff right at the top as you open the app so you can just jump straight it. Simple and brilliant.
"I've had an amazing experience with Spotify, especially with buying Premium and removing ads. A great app, highly recommended."
"Spotify is naturally an amazing music platform. Their library is lovely and you're hard pressed to find something not available, even given the copyright issues with international releases. The UI is fantastic and highly responsive. As a premium user I've nothing but praise to be honest."
It is a very interesting app. It allows me to find songs that are very old and also the latest ones. I surely recommend this app to be used as a music player.
"It's one of a kind among others. It's probably the best out there but the payment system, at least in Nigeria is fraught with lots of difficulties. I've been trying to pay for the premium package since last December to no avail."
I really love this app. It has a wide selection of music and podcasts to choose from. I also like that the payment plans for premium are varied and one can comfortably choose a plan that works for them.
"I am just in love with this app, all the functionalities added in this are really so thoughtful and impressive specially all the sorting of the songs and can listen with your friends also on which device the song playing and quality of music, collection everything is just awesome.Kudos to the app team!!"
"My app is restarting my playlist from the very beginning instead of continuing. (Ex. I can play a song in the middle of the playlist and once that song goes off, it'll jump back to the first song of that playlist) smh Has been doing this for the past 2 weeks and it's getting old. I just uninstalled and reinstalled the app back but still....the SAME THING!!!!! UPDATE: The app had been working fine over a year now. Maybe it was something wrong with the app."
It's just the best music app... Different playlists according to your taste..just how you listen...This app just knows you very well and won't stay behind in impressing you
Very Happy with the Spotify music app lots of great features and music and podcasts to choose from.
Very good so far. I can find any song i like and also different language easy to find and hear favourite song at the same time as i do my work i love it. Doing paper work is stressful and music really get rid of stress i will give it 50 stars
Awesome app! Almost every artist and almost every song from every artist. It's great being able to save stuff for listening to later and making personal playlists 10/10 üëåüèª
"Describe my experience ? I've been able to find all the songs I selected. Great app. Jan.11/22 I thought I was a bona fide aficionado of rap circa 1995 but it seems I have alot to learn from Spotify, besides the legendary KRS-ONE, this music application is my new teacer"
"I haven't been in the business of reviewing apps, but Spotify might be my favorite thing. Only thing I wanna see is a button to shuffle through a folder of playlists like you see on the computer version."
I am not a big fan of any advertising other than that I really enjoy the variety of artist and listening to my favorite songs of my past and present artists I was gifted an AQURBOOST BOOM speaker for Xmas which I use to accompany Spotify this 5 star app. Thank you and bless you.
The thing I like most about Spotify is the algorithm that suggests new artists and music it thinks you will like based off your preferences. It seems to know your musical taste even better than you do yourself! I use the discover weekly playlist to get new artists and songs based on my musical interests!
"Everything on music that's this app. You want it it'll find and play, regardless to content in any culture and language, pod cast needs slight improvement. Other the that it gets a big thumbs upüëçüëçüëèüòÅ"
I like it because if you turn off the device you can continue listening to your favorite music and go to other pages in the same way you can continue listening and the offers are great üëç
"what can I say...it's almost like I'm cracking my head to find bugs but there is almost none, except for the fact that I'd really like to see no. of streams on every song. And also, I find it difficult to upgrade to a paid plan, it rejects my Mastercard sometimes."
"No doubt, the only music streaming app worth paying for the premium service. No second thoughts, coming from an audiophile and fan of any and all genres across the board. Love discovery, and love revisiting old and nearly forgotten faves, as quick as I can search. Run-on sentence? Sorry Mrs. McGuckin, you old hag!"
It's a really nice app if u ask me. I can listen to all the songs I want. I mean there are some songs that are not available but in general they have everything.
"Great music selection! Spotify includes hard to find groups and genres, like niche folk music from little known regions. I like that there's a free version of the app with friendly quirky ads :)"
"Been a premium subscriber for many years. Spotify is hands down the best music streaming service, I'll never use anything else."
"I don't think I have ever run into a problem with Spotify itself, I use It to stream all my music and the sound quality you get with premium is way worth it"
"I have been using this app since around 2018 and I would say it is pretty good I don't have any complains. I don't have premium cause I'm just not going to pay for it, but I don't mind the ads either so yea."
Using Spotify Premium Duo. Love that I can download Playlists to listen to on the go without needing data and that my bf can have his own joined account for a minimal price difference. Would recommend for anyone / couples out there that love discovering and sharing music!
My personal experience with Spotify is awesome and I would not change a thing and I love the fact that my family can also enjoy wonderful and joyful keep up the good work
"Love the options to see the Playlist. Sometimes I am not close to my technology to rate a song while playing, later am able to swipe to see what just played and click on the heart."
New to Spotify and love it. If you are thinking of subscribing and you are a music lover do it. It's amazing...
Easy to use especially searching songs in relation to themes. I love the fact that most of the artist I know are accessible.
I love this app so much because it has all of my favorite songs and the lyrics are the best! Even if you arent using the lyrics the lyrics goes with the song!
Great library. The sharing option is convenient. I continue to spend many carefree hours listening to my favorite music and continue to find more previously unknown (to myself) songs and artists thanks to the recommendations.
Nice app for listening songs but only disturbing is ads just 5to 7 songs Ad will come and next number songs playing this is the thing in the app is small disturb but the app is so good to use in traveling
Love Spotify. I can listen to music I never knew existed. Spotify has opened my ears to some amazing new music. Thanks Spotify!
Awesome variety of music! I actually like Spotify more than Pandora! If I could give Spotify a higher rating I would give it a perfect 10!!!!
"So far so good, really enjoying it. Had since late December 21 and already around 300 plus songs. Play on shuffle, phone to Bluetooth speakers, or ps4 to TV surround. Can control from phone. It's a vibe. No complaints so far!"
"Whenever there is a new update , everytime spotify starts crashing..... shows songs are playing but no sound and I have tried various methods but I didn't succeed in repairing it"
Very easy to use get any band any album and any song I can think of I can always find it on spotify very pleased with my subscription with them
"I enjoy listening my music in Spotify. My only ""but"" is that the random selection of music is not the best with songs played many times"
Spotify is awesome! I haven't found any song yet that I don't have access to. The app is so easy to use and making playlists couldn't be easier or more fun. Highly recommend a monthly subscription to this app! 5 stars!!
Just loving it üòç‚ù§üíïüíñ.....seems like it just made for meü§û.....it have Many options also like the time capsule And also shows the current trending famous Indian and international üéµ...so I can easily get the name of the song which where famous and trending in the apps like insta..and short videos appüòá.......best app i ever saw.......üòö It would be like a cherry on cake if it can give free downloading on songs....but what to do bcoz it is impossible....I hope that it could be possible one day‚ù§
"Use this app everyday and have been for years. I like that I can create plsylists & share them. It is definitely worth getting the subscription. I use it for running & workouts. I've never had any issues, even when I change phone. Would recommend üëç"
It's a tiny bit slow at times but otherwise great. I love the download feature for when I'm driving and offlineüòç
Spotify is the best streaming service there is. You can download playlists play songs over and over again or choose them all for free. My favourite part is the fact that you can create your own music. I like how you can follow artists so that you get notified when they drop a song. Spotify is smart enough to suggest songs you would like based of your listening and what artists you follow. At the end of the year Spotify reviews your listening with wrapped. This is a fun look back at your year.
This is the best ever app to use! We can do other work while listening to music! It helps especially when I'm in a mood to talk to my friends and to listen to music at the same time! It also helps when I'm scrolling on BTS' Photos on Google üòÇüòÇ. 100% recommend this app!
Everything on the app is good except advertising. For that I'm continuously applying for the premium but everytime payment is getting failed.
It's just so great üëç the amount of wonderful types of music üé∂ at your fingertips and listening to the immaculate playback each time you go into a different genre without any problems or hassle at all. Spotify is 100% for me!!
"I've heard songs remembering Good memories and good new songs of all types of music. Magnificent, they've made feel more comfortable and relaxed. Good clear sounds, like Feel it flowing throughout my body."
This is literally the best way to listen to music as long as your willing to pay for premium and would actually use it enough for it to be useful. That being said I've been using it for 7 years and been paying for premium off and on for about 5 and this is 2022.
Here is a double trick for u guys!! To prevent ads!! You enjoy a song and when the song comes to an end where 5 or 10 secs left instantly select the next that is going to play so when a song is left incomplete ads don't pop out (some case it will not work but does 75%) [or] when ad starts playing click the song and come out of the app clear the recent tab and go in again this is also another trick....Thank me later....Try it
"The recent updates have been amazing. The enhanced playlists actually give really good music and now a ton of songs have their lyrics attached! This app used to crash regularly but I haven't experienced a crash in probably 2 months, keep up the good work!"
"Best app for listening music. And I love that there are so many songs are there like songs of Instagram reels , songs of anime and kdrama. I am just addicted to this app So it's very safe and useful app"
"This is the best app, easy to use, works across all platforms and syncs with other apps easily. Finds recommendations that are always on point, new music or playlists that work well, great algorithms!"
Outstanding database of music. Like the lyrics feature. Looks of flexibility to create play lists.
"I love this app but I feel like it's better on a laptop since you could skip the songs without worrying about running out of skips. I would love if this could change and both the mobile and laptop to skipping songs unlimited. Anyways, I love this app and absolutely recommend. And thank you so much to the creators for making this app, this is one of the best music apps I ever used. ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"Spotify is the best music app i've tried, it's really easy to use and has a lot of recommended playlists that spotify makes, and music that you can explore, and the app is easy to use. even if a lot of people say there are a lot of ads and can't play the music they like because of the new update, just pay for spotify it's really cheap and you'll find spotify easier to use when you pay for it. i use spotify everyday from day to night, i thank everyone who built spotify and everyone who manages it"
"Honestly didn't like it at first but in my opinion,it's subscription is affordable to most and I love the offline dowlading options. I also like how it builds playlists based on my taste in music and Spotify wrapped is cool. I'm sure their are better options but Spotify is easy to use and has never shown itself to be a bad app."
"Spotify is awesome as a service. I literally signed up because of Joe Rogan. I've been thinking about it ever since Rogan and Spotify signed their deal, but their adherence to their contract despite controversy sealed the deal. The user interface for the app isn't exactly intuitive. It is challenging to get back and forth into the queue versus a play list versus an album that I'm looking at. I would maybe suggest multiple tabs that are easy to access."
"I've found music that I haven't heard since I was in high school, really good for helping with music your not sure what the name is. Just a really Good place to Listen to your Tunes!‚úåüíì"
"Great app allows downloads. I have a really eclectic taste in music, podcasts etc and they're all covered like I say cracking app with almost no tech issues."
"New to this. So easy to use. Loving building my library with a variety of media. Would like to see more female writers in the audio book menu. Family package is excellent. I'm not all that fussed about the digital world, but I'm really engaging with Spotify I am enjoying having easy access to my favourite artists and listening to new stuff based in Spotify's recommendations."
I can find 95% of the tunes I search for on Spotify. Their automated playlists hit the spot. Still waiting for the higher resolution streaming service though.
"Love Spotify mobile and have for years. I swear the app runs better than my desktop application most days. Very user friendly, with a large diversity of musicians. This app gets me through the day and is easily the most used thing on my phone."
I love being able to play what I want when I want ad free and being able to download songs so I can play them even out of service area. I dislike when other people are using Pandora etc and I have to listen to their stupid ads and have to listen to what is played not what you pick. So thankful for Spotify.
"*Still stand by limits to free acct . But Prem. Us only 10$ Worth that and then sum! Awsome, only thing is if dont pay cant skip tracks or choose whats playing can get frustrating to think of song search it then cant even play right the np"
This is the most greatest app tp play music on! I've been using Spotify for 2 years now and haven't experienced any bugs/glitches! I highly recommend Spotify!
"I would highly recommend this app to anyone who loves music. Everything is simple and easy to use, while recommending new music to you, that really does match your preferences."
I love bc when you premium you can do a lot of things and the music's unlimited there's not all the music that you want but there's most of it and if you can't find a song you're looking for you type up the lyrics and other people have made albums with the music in the album
"With YouTube's rapid, uncontrollable descent into hedgemonic behaviour, its belligerent attitude towards users, its Premium subscription and bundled music app (YT Music) are no longer worthy of my time or money. Luckily, SPOTIFY turns out to be a perfect and much better alternative app to music streaming, and with better streaming quality. My upgrade to 5 stars was not trivial, and I hope that Spotify continues to improve and most importantly continues to take their users' opinions seriously."
"Spotify has everything I like to listen to and more. Create your own playlists, mix and match music to satisfy your mood. My #1 go to when I hit the highways and just wanna hear it all."
"Love it!!! Finally found an app that I can create a playlist without ads & it's free! Up to date on music trends, can listen to others playlist. Found some oldies but goodies too! Lol Thank you Spotify!!!"
Just glad that the lyrics feature is back on the roll after a very long time. Moreover the little ui tweaks day by day is also great and enhances the experience than what it was before. Happy to be a premium member and keep up with the minimal great changes :)
"Always great. I have been a Spotify Premium user for 5 years +. It's been great. Friendly user interface, always the greatest newest music in high quality. I love the new Blend mode with friends and the yearly reviews. It would be really need to see a chat involved with the Friend Blends to comment and communate about tracks on them between each other."
"I really love Spotify, it one of my top used apps. And I love to listen to a studying play list will I'm studying it helps a lot and Spotify is just an over all really great app and I highly recommend for u to download it if u haven't already. üòÇüòÇI love doing this üòÇ üòÇ it let's me sound like an overly paid critic üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
I really enjoy Spotify... and all the access to so much great music... even the occasional commercials are usually amusing... Spotify is an excellent option....
It's usually a great app but very buggy lately. Keeps freezing and stopping then refusing to play again unless I restart everything. Not a signal issue as it does it when I'm connected to my home WiFi. Pretty frustrating.
"All round great app. Well worth paying the subscription for. Discover weekly is my favorite feature, I've discovered so many artists I now love. Also appreciate the ability to download songs for offline use, no other app has stood the test of time like Spotify has for me."
"I'm not very good with this kind of stuff, but I'm persevering and it's getting easier for me to listen to all my favourites and find new music, anyone with a little more brainpower will love it"
